# Steel-on-Bone
Glover Patch and Ableton Session for Steel on Bone by Zubin Kanga
This is a patch in Glover (the tool used to map inputs/outputs of MiMU sensor gloves) and Ableton Live (which takes the data from the gloves and turns these into live sound manipulations). The pair were used in Steel on Bone, which uses the gloves to control the speed of multiple delay lines, granulate the sound to different degrees, and also sample recordings from the inside of the piano, using gesture to trigger the samples, and motion to control filters applied to them.
